# Harmony Home Designs
Harmony Home Designs, a simulated interior design service provider, is built using Express.js, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. This endeavor serves as a practical playground for refining skills in jQuery, a widely-used JavaScript library.

# Features
1. Homepage: Animated counting numbers using jQuery was applied under the 'hero' section of the homepage.  The code iterates over each selected element using `each() function and retrieves the target count value from it's 'data-count' attribute. Then animates the count from the current value of the element to the target count value using jQuery's `animate() function'.
2. Homepage: jQuery slick carousel was applied to the "services" section of the homepage. A customizable carousel/slider plugin that allows you to create responsive, touch-enabled carousels with smooth transitions.
3. Homepage: In the last section before the footer section, Magnific Popup, a jQuery lightbox plugin was added to display a variety of photos. A fun way to make the gallery capture the user's attention.
4. Responsive Design: Harmony Home Designs is designed to be responsive across various devices and screen sizes. Enjoy a consistent and user-friendly experience!

# Creator Notes
It took nearly a week to finish this frontend project. I enjoyed learning about jQuery as it provided a concise and easy-to-use syntax for selecting and manipulating HTML elements in the DOM. I particularly enjoyed jQuery's extensive beginner-friendly plugin ecosystem.
